  - name: landscape
    summary: Indicates if the device is currently held in landscape form.
    description: |
        Value is `true` if in landscape, and `false` otherwise.
    type: Boolean
    accessors: false
    permission: read-only
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]

  - name: orientation
    summary: Orientation of the device.
    description: |
        Value may be one of the group of <Titanium.UI> orientation constants,
        <Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT>,
        <Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT>,
        <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT>,
        <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>,
        <Titanium.UI.FACE_UP>,
        <Titanium.UI.FACE_DOWN>,
        or <Titanium.UI.UNKNOWN>.

        On iOS and Windows, returns the current orientation of the *device*,
        regardless of the window orientation. To determine the current window orientation,
        use [Window.orientation](Titanium.UI.Window.orientation).

        To set the *allowable* orientations for a window, see <Titanium.UI.Window.orientationModes>.

events:
  - name: orientationchange
    summary: Fired when the device orientation changes.
    description: |
        On Android, note that the application must have a heavyweight window or tab group open
        in order to receive the `orientationchange` event. It is not necessary for the  heavyweight
        window to be the topmost window.

        Almost all real-world applications will have a heavyweight window or a tab group. This is
        only likely to be an issue if you create a test case or test application that adds an
        orientation change listener from `app.js` without opening a heavyweight window.
    properties:
      - name: orientation
        summary: Orientation of the device.
        type: Number
        constants: [Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT, Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT, Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_*,
                    Titanium.UI.FACE_*, Titanium.UI.UNKNOWN]

  - name: shake
    summary: Fired when the device is shaken.
    description: |
        A shake gesture consists of a series of quick accelerations, and is represented by a series
        of shake events.

        The `timestamp` property represents the interval between shake events. It is measured in
        milliseconds on Android, and in seconds on iOS.
    properties:

      - name: timestamp
        summary: |
            Time interval since previous shake event. On iOS, this value is 0 for the first shake
            event in a series.
        type: Number

      - name: x
        summary: Acceleration along the X axis, in Gs.
        type: Number

      - name: y
        summary: Acceleration along the Y axis, in Gs.
        type: Number

      - name: z
        summary: Acceleration along the Z axis, in Gs.
