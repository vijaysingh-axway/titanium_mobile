name: Titanium.Analytics
summary: |
    Used for transmitting developer-defined Analytics events to the Appcelerator Analytics product. 
description: |
    The Analytics module can be used to supply additional context or application-specific 
    information which can then be accessed during analysis using Analytics.

    Use the [featureEvent](Titanium.Analytics.featureEvent) method to generate custom
    events that you can view through the Analytics product. You can specify a name for 
    the feature event which is visible through Analytics.

    **NOTE** The Analytics module lets you transmit some data that is stored, but 
    not made accessible through the Analytics UI. To access this data, you must
    sign up for the optional raw data export service. 
    
    *The following types of data are stored but not made available through the Analytics UI:*

    *   Navigation events.

    *   Extra data added to feature events (the `data` parameter).
    
    Viewing navigation events in the Analytics UI will be supported in a future version 
    of the Analytics product. There is no plan to support the other event types, and they 
    should not be used.

    **GDPR Compliance**

    The Ti.Analytics namespace in Titanium is GDPR compliant since SDK 7.2.0. End users
    should be able to opt out of Analytics using the <Titanium.Analytics.optedOut> property.
    If a user opted out from Analytics and you still call Analytics events, they will be ignored.

    Note: This does not affect your app until you make use of the `optedOut` property. Once
    enabled for your users (e.g. by having a <Titanium.UI.Switch> in your settings), you
    should handle it within your app logic.

    summary: Allows the user to opt out from Analytics during runtime to comply to GPDR.
    description: |
        Once opted out, no Analytics events will be sent anymore. If implemented to the end user,
        ensure to check if the user is opted out before trying to send an Analytics event.
        In case you do not guard the Analytics call, it will be ignored silently.

        Here is an example of a guarded Analytics call:

        ``` js
        if (!Ti.Analytics.optedOut) {
          Ti.Analytics.featureEvent('gdpr_rocks');
        }
        ```

examples:
  - title: Custom Feature Event
    example: |
        This example shows how to send a feature event during an application session to indicate 
        some feature that you would like to track was used.

        ``` js
        Ti.Analytics.featureEvent('app.feature');
        ```

        In this case, the Analytics product would show statistics about how many times the
        'app.feature' event was generated.
