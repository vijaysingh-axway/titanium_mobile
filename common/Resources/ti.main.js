 * - Provide consistent startup behavior between platforms, such as logging Titanium version.
 * - Load Titanium's core JavaScript extensions shared by all platforms.
 * - Provide "*.bootstrap.js" script support. (Similar to native module onAppCreate()/load() support.)
 * - Load the app developer's main "app.js" script after doing all of the above.
